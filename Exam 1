Combine some or all of these to form one or more hypothesis tests about differences. Explain carefully the question(s) and answer(s) of the hypothesis test(s). I expect that different people may choose different levels of significance. Please provide estimate, standard error, t-stat and a p-value for each hypothesis test and a confidence interval. __Write a paragraph__ explaining each test (carefully noting what is the null hypothesis) and explaining the results of that test along with what assumptions are needed for the test to be valid.

THE hypothesis test for the data, is that  the null hypothesis is age and marijuana use are independent and our alt hypothesis is that age and marijuana use are dependent. 
The levels of signinifance I choose were alpha = 0.05. After I combined the age ranges of the data I had 4 columns of age ranges from 21-32, 37-47, 52-62, 67-82. I kept the rows to be 1 totaling
one or more days of marijuana use, and zero to be one days of marijuana use. After running the test I found the critcal value of the data set to be 7.815. However the date had a test statistic of 
116076.1472. This was greater than the critical value and as result I rejected the null hypothesis. However there is not enough data to prove that the alternative hypothesis is correct. 
There is enough to determine that age and marjunan usage are not independent.
